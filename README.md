Programming:
-	Programming is a step-by-step process to solve a problem.
-	You can think of it like a recipe where you need to determine what ingredients you need and in what step they go into the process.
-	The result of programming is called the output. Much in the same way a rib roast dinner is made, or a cake is baked.

Control flow:
-	The order in which a computer executes statements in a script is called control flow.
-	Code is run from the first line to the last line, unless the computer comes across statements that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
 
Functions:
-	Functions are a block of code designed to perform a specific task.
-	They are executed when they are being “called” by something to perform an action.
-	They are a fundamental building block of JavaScript.
-	A function is similar to a procedure, which is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.
-	In order to use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope of the code from which you wish to call it.
-	The first thing a function does is get input. The last thing a function does is return a response.

Expressions and Operators:
-	An expression is any valid unit of code that produces a value when resolved.
-	For example, an expression can be a variable name that equals whatever value you assign to it. 
-	The value you assign to it can be anything from a number to a string, to a boolean.
-	Operators are symbols that used to assign values, perform operations (e.g., arithmetic) on operands.
